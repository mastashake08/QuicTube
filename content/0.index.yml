  title: Why choose our service?
  description: I think y'all forgot what the web and Internet was supposed to be! We should not only own our data but we should profit from it if we so choose! Are you a music artist? You should be actually earning scrilla for your streams/direct purchases! QuicTube is my first application in a suite of HTTP/3 apps I am writing to decentralize the web utilizing the technologies that we currently have.

    - quote: The Internet has become a playground of corporations holding corners of power. Email was originally meant to be ran at home, not through central servers. The whole concept of decentralization was a cornerstore of the Internet and its protocols. Media takes up the majority of our data consumption. Why do we let others monetize on our value when we can pofit from ourselves?
